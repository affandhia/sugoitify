    3. Connect a 330Ω resistor from the ECHO pin of the sensor to a different
       GPIO pin.

    4. Connect a 470Ω resistor from ground to the ECHO GPIO pin. This forms
       the required voltage divider.

    5. Finally, connect the VCC pin of the sensor to a 5V pin on the Pi.

    The following code will periodically report the distance measured by the
    sensor in cm assuming the TRIG pin is connected to GPIO17, and the ECHO
    pin to GPIO18::

        from gpiozero import DistanceSensor
        from time import sleep

        sensor = DistanceSensor(echo=18, trigger=17)
        while True:
            print('Distance: ', sensor.distance * 100)
            sleep(1)

    :param int echo:
        The GPIO pin which the ECHO pin is attached to. See
        :ref:`pin-numbering` for valid pin numbers.

    :param int trigger:
        The GPIO pin which the TRIG pin is attached to. See
        :ref:`pin-numbering` for valid pin numbers.

    :param int queue_len:
        The length of the queue used to store values read from the sensor.
        This defaults to 30.

    :param float max_distance:
        The :attr:`value` attribute reports a normalized value between 0 (too
        close to measure) and 1 (maximum distance). This parameter specifies
        the maximum distance expected in meters. This defaults to 1.

    :param float threshold_distance:
        Defaults to 0.3. This is the distance (in meters) that will trigger the
        ``in_range`` and ``out_of_range`` events when crossed.

    :param bool partial:
        When ``False`` (the default), the object will not return a value for
        :attr:`~SmoothedInputDevice.is_active` until the internal queue has
        filled with values.  Only set this to ``True`` if you require values
        immediately after object construction.

    :param Factory pin_factory:
        See :doc:`api_pins` for more information (this is an advanced feature
        which most users can ignore).
