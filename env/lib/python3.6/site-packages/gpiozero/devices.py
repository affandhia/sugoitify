        Shut down the device and release all associated resources. This method
        can be called on an already closed device without raising an exception.

        This method is primarily intended for interactive use at the command
        line. It disables the device and releases its pin(s) for use by another
        device.

        You can attempt to do this simply by deleting an object, but unless
        you've cleaned up all references to the object this may not work (even
        if you've cleaned up all references, there's still no guarantee the
        garbage collector will actually delete the object at that point).  By
        contrast, the close method provides a means of ensuring that the object
        is shut down.

        For example, if you have a breadboard with a buzzer connected to pin
        16, but then wish to attach an LED instead:

            >>> from gpiozero import *
            >>> bz = Buzzer(16)

            >>> bz.close()
            >>> led = LED(16)
            >>> led.blink()

        :class:`Device` descendents can also be used as context managers using
        the :keyword:`with` statement. For example:

            >>> from gpiozero import *
            >>> with Buzzer(16) as bz:
